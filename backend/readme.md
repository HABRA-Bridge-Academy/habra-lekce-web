# How to run

1. Install dependencies

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. Create .env file  
    Most importantly, specify database connection string, without this the server will fail. 

3. Run server executable with node.js
    ```bash
    node ./bin/www
    ```

    You need to have node.js installed. Sever works with version 20, other versions might work as well.
